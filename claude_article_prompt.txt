4. Use appropriate subheadings if necessary.
5. Aim for approximately 150-200 words for an h2 section, 100-150 for an h3 section, and 50-100 for an h4 section, depending on the depth of the section and it's importance in answering the topic.
6. Consider the full outline provided above. If aspects of this section are covered in depth elsewhere in the article, focus on providing a concise overview and unique insights rather than extensive repetition.
7. If the section has a list of yet points, structure each main point within the section as a bold heading followed by an explanatory paragraph. Format these key points like this:
   **{{Key Point{{}}:** Explanatory paragraph...

After writing the new section, please output only the newly written section.
